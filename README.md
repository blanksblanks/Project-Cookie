### PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

We haven't really come up for an idea yet, but we are interested in adding a feature to Lev's open-source generator :zap: for creating MEAN-stack applications! Nina is also interested in game dev :black_joker: so that might be an fun idea too

### Additional Notes:

- Not sure why we're called Project Cookie, it was Cheng's idea and maybe has to do with the fact that we were eating lace cookies that Bingyan brought before class? :dog:
- Open to additional ideas and teammates~ :hatched_chick: :balloon:
